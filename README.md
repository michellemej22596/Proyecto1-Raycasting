# Software Rendering - 02 - Line

## Objective

- Understand and implement Bresenham's line drawing algorithm.
- Integrate the line drawing functionality with the existing framebuffer and BMP writer classes.
- Draw lines and output the result as a BMP file.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository and switch to the `SR-02-Line` branch:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/menene/cc2018-30-2-2024.git
    cd cc2018-30-2-2024
    git checkout SR-02-Line
    ```

2. Build and run the project:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

3. Check the `output.bmp` file in the project directory to see the points you have drawn.
